   cd mystore
   ```

2. yarn install

3. yarn dev

## Assumptions

2. Cart persistence only requires localStorage (no backend).
3. Filters and sort state are stored in the URL query string for refresh persistence.
4. Accessibility is important: semantic HTML, alt attributes, aria-labels are included.

## Time Spent

plus or minus 14hrs including planning, development and documentation.
